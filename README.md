## What is Zation?
Zation is an application server framework that lets you build fast, real-time, secure, and scalable backends. 
You can scale it on more CPU cores or machines/instances. 
It's ideal for creating real-time apps, e.g. mobile apps with react-native, multiplayer games, or real-time statistic apps. 
The Zation API is providing lots of functions, like a big toolbox, and is well structured and documented. 
The complete framework has full typescript and promises support. 
Also, it's easy to use, which lets you build big backends very quickly. 
The Zation framework also provides client libraries for communicating to the backend and a library for testing the server. 
Another nice feature of the Zation framework is configuration error detection. 
This feature will check your configurations for errors. 
If fatal errors are detected, the server won't start to protect you from an unsafe or faulty backend.

**Notice that Zation is in development, and the final documentation is not finished yet.**
